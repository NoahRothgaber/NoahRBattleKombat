# NoahRBattleKombat
A rock paper scissors style mortal kombat tribute, made in C++

You have arrived on Shang Tsung's Island and unbeknownst to you, so have 3 others. As is customary in the world of Mortal Kombat, you shall fight! 

There are 3 possible rounds to play in, with three combat options. Attacking uses stamina and deals damage, Defending uses stamina and negates damage (to a min of 0 damage), and resting recovers small amounts of stamina and health.

This game was designed with utilizing some of the more advanced features of C++ and showcases the use of
1. Friend Functions
2. Virtual Functions
3. Object Oriented Prinicples
4. The Smart Pointer System
5. 0, 3, 5 rule enforcement
6. Abstract Classes and Implementations
7. A cool ASCII character select screen :)

The front end is text based, and the back end primarily uses Kharacter objects to handle combat between players.
